# Local fonts
I've mostly used fonts from Google's library throughout this repo. I don't think there's a huge risk-- if my website is still up but Google is down, the world might be ending anyway.

That said, I am playing around with using a VGA-DOS inspired font for the static page. I'm uploading the ttf here so I can embed it into my page, but the usage rights are a little fuzzy. In any case, credit belongs to [Zeh Fernando](https://www.linkedin.com/in/avi-amalanshu/) for this lovely font and [DaFont](https://www.dafont.com/perfect-dos-vga-437.font) for hosting it (click that link to see the listing I got it from).

For what it's worth, DaFont's listing says it's "100% Free" but there is no explicit license so I'm not sure. If you are a stakeholder in this font and don't like the fact that the file's uploaded here, please raise an issue on the repo.
