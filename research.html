				<h1>Brief Statement</h1>
				<p>
					My interest in communication/information theory and experience running a cash-strapped undergrad robotics group have played a major role in my
					interest in parallel, distributed and real-time/online learning with the goal of leveraging large scale, personal computing to learn deep models 
					in the wild.
				</p>
				<p> 
                  The primary motivation behind my research is developing the tools and methodology to make AI systems more <b>usable and democratic</b>. This involves a bidirectional push. From the bottom-up, this means large scale computation and data. From the top-down, this means figuring out how to train more efficient, generalizable and safe models. 
                  <p>
                  This requires a study of a wide range of interesting topics, from networks and distributed systems to unsupervised learning, randomized algorithms, and game theory. 
                  </p>

                <h1>Areas of Interest</h1>
                <p>Here are some of my research areas, accompanied by a brief description of some direction(s) I am (or hope to) investigating.</p>
                    <h6>Unsupervised Learning & Energy-Based Models</h6>
                    <p>An asynchronous mechanism for backward feedback in energy based (or other greedy/localized) learning algorithms.</p>
                    <p> Information propagation in generative networks and privacy-preserving coding using generative networks.
                    <h6> Distributed Systems </h6>
                    <p>A peer-to-peer fault tolerance strategy for distributed learning systems.</p>
                    <h6> Online and Multi-Agent Learning </h6>
                    <p>Inverse reinforcement learning for vehicle/pedestrian trajectory prediction in real-time.</p>
                    <h6> Randomized and Approximation Algorithms </h6>
                    <p>An information-theoretic framework for analyzing convergence and complexity of randomized algorithms, particularly Las Vegas algorithms.</p>

                <h1>Projects</h1>
            <p>I have not had a chance to fill out this section yet (WIP). Other than the projects on my CV (see menu bar), I've worked on some image processing and computer vision (mainly robotic perception: scene understanding and trajectory prediction). In late '23 to early '24 I plan to  take up some projects in inverse RL and unsupervised vision.</p>
