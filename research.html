				<h1>Research Statement</h1>
				<p>
                    I am interested in developing algorithms that enable online and distributed/federated learning with theoretical guarantees. I also
                    work on applications in context-rich applications, e.g. scene understanding, robotic trajectory prediction, financial markets, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One question I am invested in: How do we build an alternative to end-to-end training with backprop that is a plausible model
                    of how the brain learns? Such a regime would yield some desirable characteristics. Local plasticity, like 
                    observed in the cortical sheet, would allow better model parallelism while improving time and space complexity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another fascinating direction: Can we analyze communication constraints between neurons of a neural network to build an
                    explainable model? If so, how do we leverage that to build better algorithms and architectures? This also lends to a 
                    discussion on the information theoretic consequences of generative models and their usage as coding techniques.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is a class of problems based on optimizing probability of error under some information constraint, and
                    engineering that information constraint itself using optimization and game theory. These problems are pervasive and far reaching 
                    (just a few examples are machine learning: inference/reinforcement, digital communications: detection/channel 
                    allocation, robotics: 
                    trajectory prediction/path planning, economics: macroeconomics/microeconomics).
                    <br>
                    My general interest is in designing efficient and distributed algorithms for agents in such problems.
                    I am excited about bridging the theoretical gaps between these areas. Extending decentralization to some
                    collocated paradigms is especially intriguing. This will make intelligent systems more accessible. It 
                    will also allow us to leverage wide scale computation to efficiently construct fairer and more robust models.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An emerging field that may benefit from all these efforts is neuroeconomics.
                </p>
