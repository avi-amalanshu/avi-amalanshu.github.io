				<h1>Research Statement</h1>
		        <p> 
		            I am interested broadly in computational intelligence and distributed systems. I work on online and distributed/federated algorithms and systems 
					for deep learning and reinforcement learning. I am also interested in generative modelling and unsupervised learning. Generally fascinated by 
					decentralized/P2P systems. 
				</p>
				<p>
					My interest in communication/information theory and experience running a cash-strapped undergrad research group have played a major role in my
					interest in parallel, distributed and real-time/online learning with the goal of leveraging large scale, personal computing to learn deep models 
					in the wild. My current interests follow these broad themes:
				</p>
                <h3>Computational Intelligence</h3>
				<p>
					
					I am fond of what I call "nature-inspired" algorithms-- bioplausible learning, evolutionary computation, neural ODEs, PINNs, etc. It's not 
					necessarily good practice to restrict our imagination to our continuous, probabilistic world in matters regarding our programmable digital 
					computers. But, they serve an important scientific purpose: as models of adaptation in ourselves and our surroundings. Natural systems 
					are a great source of inspiration. Biologically plausible learning eliminates synchronization and memory constraints which enable better 
					parallelism and pipelining. Energy-based models (though perhaps on mortal, neuromorphic hardware) may soon match MLPs with backpropagation, 
					except far more efficiently. And indeed, none of today's life-saving ML applications would exist had we discarded neural networks to pursue 
					symbolic AI.
				</p>
				<p>
					A problem I am interested in: How do we model top-down attention in the brain as a biologically plausible feedback mechanism for ANNs? The 
					feedback may allow scalable representation learning using local computation that is comparable to global backprop.
				</p>
                <h3>Statistical Machine Learning and Information Theory</h3>
				<p>
					I am interested in some statistical aspects of learning theory. My bachelor's thesis is in the area of distributed hypothesis testing. Another fascinating direction: Can we analyze communication constraints between neurons in an ANN to 
					build an explainable model of deep learning? If so, how do we leverage that to build better algorithms and architectures? This also lends to a discussion on the information theoretic consequences of generative models and their usage with secure coding techniques.
				</p>
                <h3>Applications in complex multi-agent environments</h3>
				<p>
					On the application side, I like to use domain knowledge to build robust models for economic and almost-economic agents.  By this I mean prediction and control in large-scale and/or safety-critical interactions like autonomous driving, financial markets, biophysical 
					interactions, biomedical imaging, etc. Another problem I am hoping to dive into: Can we use inverse RL to to replace bulky RNN/attention models for robotic trajectory prediction?
