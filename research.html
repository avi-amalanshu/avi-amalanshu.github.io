				<h1>Research Statement</h1>
                <p> 
                    Broadly, my interest is in designing online and distributed/federated algorithms and systems for 
                    deep learning and reinforcement learning. I am also generally interested in communication networks
                    and distributed systems.
                    On the application side, I like to use domain knowledge to build robust models for macro/microeconomic tasks.
                    By this I mean prediction and control with large-scale and/or safety-critical interactions like autonomous driving,
                    financial markets, biophysical interactions, biomedical imaging, etc.
                </p>

                    Over the past few decades, much of deep learning research has focused on building increasingly 
                    complex architectures that can learn general hypotheses for difficult tasks. This is significant
                    as a proof-of-concept for AI. Moreover, pushing boundaries toward and past expert human performance
                    has lead to breakthroughs in critical fields like healthcare. However, increasing complexity
                    brings diminishing gains from computational resources and data. My research focus 
                    is on developing methodology that can guarantee similar model performance in a real-time, online and
                    distributed manner. From a research and engineering perspective, this opens up a lot of flexbility in using compute
                    and deploying models. It also can help democratize AI, and learn fairer and more general models. Here are some
                    questions I am investigating (or planning to) as an undergrad: 
                </p>
                <p>
                    How do we build an alternative to end-to-end training with backprop that is a plausible model
                    of how the brain learns? Such a regime would yield some desirable characteristics. Local plasticity, like 
                    observed in the cortical sheet, would allow better model parallelism while improving time and space complexity.
                    The brain learns without manual labeling and in a contrastive manner. This paradigm can allow machines to learn rich feature representations online from a very wide real-world data distribution. Applications to generative modelling
                    can lead to much faster and more abstract generative networks.
                    <br>
                    This area has seen a surge of interest lately, but most proposals do not scale well to deep models or hard datasets.
                </p>
							      Another important question for distributed learning (and, frankly, machine learning in general) is distribution
							      shift. Not only should a distributed/federated learning system be able to learn from divergent distributions,
							      but an edge application should be able to make sound predictions in its own environment which may be unseen by the
							      model. Since preventing overfitting during training can only go so far with performance constraints, distribution
							      alignment is a better approach.
                <p>
                    Another fascinating direction: Can we analyze communication constraints between neurons of a neural network to build an
                    explainable model of deep learning? If so, how do we leverage that to build better algorithms and architectures? This also lends to a 
                    discussion on the information theoretic consequences of generative models and their usage as privacy-preserving coding techniques.
                </p>
                <p>
                   On the application side, is it possible for inverse reinforcement learning to replace bulky recurrent/attention-based models for robotic
                   trajectory prediction? This can be directly tied into reinforcement learning-based path planning algorithms, especially in swarm robotics where
							      efficient communication allows an ego agent to know reward functions from at least some other agents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An emerging field that may benefit from all these efforts is neuroeconomics.
                </p>
