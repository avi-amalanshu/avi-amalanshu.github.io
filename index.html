				<h1>welcome to my website!</h1>
				<p>hello, I'm a second-year undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur (IIT-KGP). I'm enrolled in the dual degree (bachelor + master of technology) program offered by the department of electronics and electrical communication engineering.</p>
				<p>my research interests so far roughly lie in the area of computer vision, automation, and more broadly artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning.</p>
				<p>at IIT-KGP, I'm involved with the Autonomous Ground Vehicle (AGV) research group, where I'm a part of the "deep learning - trajectory" module of the software team. I'm also involved with the KGP Gaming Society, where I'm a part of the core and design teams.</p>
