				<h1>welcome to my website!</h1>
				<p>hello, I'm a second-year undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur (IIT-KGP).</p>
				<p>my research interests so far roughly lie in the area of computer vision, automation, and more broadly artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning.</p>
				<p>at IIT-KGP, I'm involved with the Autonomous Ground Vehicle (AGV) research group, where I'm a part of the "deep learning - trajectory" module of the software team. I'm also involved with the KGP Gaming Society, where I'm a part of the core and design teams.</p>

								<p>as mentioned in the intro above, my interests so far are related to computer vision, and artificial intelligence at large.</p>
								<p>I also plan to explore the fields of computer architecture, embedded systems, cybersecurity and IoT in the future.</p>

								<p>I'm an avid programmer with an intermediate skill level in C, C++ and Python. I'm also a novice at SQL, MATLAB, Octave and Java.</p>
								<p>apart from delving deeper into these languages, I plan to get into Rust if it survives the pandemic, and perhaps other languages such as Go or Scala in the near future.</p>
								<p>I have worked on some projects with OpenCV and SciKit, and have some experience with ROS and TensorFlow, too.</p>
								<p>I prioritize robustness and efficiency while writing programs.</p>
								<hr>
								<p>I'm enrolled in the dual degree course offered by the department of electronics and communication engineering at IIT Kharagpur. I'm expecting to graduate in 2025 with bachelor and master of technology degrees. I hope to pursue a minor degree in computer science and engineering, too.

								<p>although I have various social media accounts, I am not active on any of them. They exist mainly for the purpose of redirecting traffic to my website/github.</p>
								<p>perhaps a mutually agreeable way to contact me would be to e-mail me at sbo+s,s;smdji#rmhomrrt/vp. (after, of course, rotating all characters left on the QWERTY keyboard -- it's first_last at engineer).</p>
