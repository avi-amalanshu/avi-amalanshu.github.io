				<h1>welcome to my website!</h1>
				<p>hello, I'm a second-year undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur (IIT-KGP) interested in computer vision, automation, and more broadly artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning.</p>
				<p>at IIT-KGP, I'm involved with the Autonomous Ground Vehicle (AGV) research group, where I'm a part of the "deep learning - trajectory" module of the software team. I'm also involved with the KGP Gaming Society, where I'm a part of the core and design teams.</p>

							<p>as mentioned in the intro above, my interests so far are related to computer vision, and artificial intelligence at large.</p>
							<p>I also plan to explore the fields of computer architecture, embedded systems, cybersecurity and IoT in the future.</p>

							<p>apart from being a musician and a menace on the basketball court, I'm an avid programmer with an intermediate skill level in C, C++ and Python. I'm also a novice at SQL, MATLAB, Octave and Java.</p>
							<p>in the near future, I plan to get into Rust, and perhaps other languages such as Go and Scala.</p>
							<p>I have worked on some projects with OpenCV and SciKit, and have some experience with ROS and TensorFlow, too.</p>
							<p>I prioritize robustness and efficiency while writing programs.</p>

							<p>my most recent project was a <a href="https://github.com/avi-amalanshu/DIY-Project-Hand-Controlled-Bot">hand-gesture controlled camera robot using OpenCV and mediapipe</a>. This was my group's final project for the DIY course in my first year at IIT Kharagpur. Although it was intended for the healthcare sector (to reduce doctors' and nurses' exposure to disease), it has a very wide range of potential applications.</p>
