## my website haha lol

Static HTML website with bootstrap CSS and no JS (except for the email scraper spoof + dropdown on the index page). Very modular and responsive, being bootstrap. Feel free to use/adapt (with the customary shoutout, of course ðŸ˜‰).

Edit: Because Safari and Firefox are being slow to pick up, I need to use a js polyfill for scroll-driven animations. Hopefully soon I won't need to anymore.
