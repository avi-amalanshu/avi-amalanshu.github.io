## my website haha lol

Static HTML website with CSS and no JS. The CSS is inline and all animations are scroll-driven based on the new functionality.

Feel free to adapt this for your own purposes (with the customary shoutout of course ðŸ¤“), not the most modular as of right now but maybe I will refactor it one day.

Because Safari and Firefox are being slow to pick up, I need to use a js polyfill for scroll-driven animations. Hopefully soon I won't need to anymore.
